React Wordpress Theme
===

This project is used as a Wordpress template made with React and Wordpress REST API
---

This is my website template made for my toastmasters club in Warsaw.
[Toastmasters ASBIRO](http://toastmasters.asbiro.pl/)

To Work properly on Your wordpress site You need to install two plugins:
* [WP REST API Frontpage](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-frontpage/)
* [WP REST API MENUS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-v2-menus/)

Both are free and add new endpoints to REST API

**Confirguration**

*Carousel*

To choose images which will appear in slideshow You need to fill field 'caption' with name 'carousel' 

in 
'''"Your_wordpress_site_dashbord" -> "Media" -> "Library" -> "Your_image"'''

The 'Alt Text' is also a slogan of a slide
